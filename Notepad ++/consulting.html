<h2>What is Hyperautomation?</h2>
<p>First, a definition of hyperautomation is in place. Hold on to your hats while we hurl through some technical lingo.

According to Gartner’s report on Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2020, hyperautomation is “the combination of multiple machine learning, packaged software and automation tools to deliver work” and it “deals with the application of advanced technologies including AI and machine learning to increasingly automate processes and augment humans.”<br> To put it simply, hyperautomation is the mix of automation technologies and artificial intelligence that, when combined, augment humans’ capabilities, allowing them to complete processes faster, more efficiently, and with fewer errors.
<br> For businesses who have yet to discover the benefits of automation, it might be useful to think of automation as an electric beater for whisking eggs: It saves you from rather exhausting work, and you’ll get better results faster. Once you’ve got an electric beater, you’ll have no ambition of going back to a regular whisk, and you won’t understand how you could ever live without the electric one in the first place.<br> Now take that same electric beater and add an intelligent timer that will stop the beater from whisking your eggs when they’re perfectly fluffy. That’s the thought behind hyperautomation.</p>

<h2>What is Multi-experience?</h2>
<p>A multi-experience development platform (MXDP) is a development platform that is used for developing not just mobile and web applications,<br> but also chat, voice, augmented reality and wearable experiences. MXDP platforms help businesses quickly scale their app development projects <br> across a range of devices, platforms, and form factors. Basically, MXDPs are the evolution of omnichannel MADPs.</p>

<h2>What is Cloud Distribution?</h2>

<p>Cloud distribution software is a cloud-based solution (often falling under enterprise resource planning (ERP) software) that serves as an effective means of automating and streamlining your day-to-day operations. For example, you might use distribution software to keep track of your warehouse inventory and to automatically organize where items should be stocked based on which items are frequently purchased together. The software could then select the most cost-effective container to ship the package in. Cloud distribution software is beneficial to a wide range of industries. Most software options are configurable and may even be open source so that you can integrate your current technology into your new software.

Also, cloud software is often more readily accessible to some companies than on-premise systems. Cloud-based products make it a lot easier for small and mid-sized companies to benefit from ERP distribution software. This is because cloud based distribution software is generally less expensive to set up than on-site software. Additionally, cloud-based products, with their low monthly fees, make it easier for some businesses to predict their expenses. Its usability is also appealing — you just need an internet connection, and you’re good to go. </p>
